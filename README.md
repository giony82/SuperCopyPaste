# SuperCopyPaste
Super Copy Paste extends the copy paste functionality in Windows by keeping track of the history. 

In some organizations is not possible to install applications like Ditto Clipboard, so my idea was to have a simple app that offers the same things as Ditto Clipboard. Windows 10 has a similar app, but is not possible to search the clipboard.
