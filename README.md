# Super Copy Paste
Super Copy Paste extends the copy paste functionality in Windows by keeping track of the history. 

In some organizations is not possible to install applications like Ditto Clipboard, so my idea was to have a simple app that of\fers the same functionalities as Ditto Clipboard. Windows 10 has a similar app, but is not possible to search the clipboard, nor to delete items older than X days. Not to mention that it's limited to the last 25 entries only.

# Key features
- See the history of all the items copied to cliboard
- Support for images and text.
- Persistent storage in a file.
- Search
- Pin items
- Show only pinned items.

# Shortcuts
- CTR - ENTER -> activates the application 
- ALT - X -> closes the application
- DEL -> Deletes the current selected row
